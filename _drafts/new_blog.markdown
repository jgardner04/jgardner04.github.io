## The new Gig
A new blog and a new role here at Microsoft. Starting today I am joining the [Azure Customer Advisory Team](//blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/azurecat/2017/01/05/hello-world-welcome-to-azurecat-guidance/#pnp). I am excited for the challenge and look forward to learning from wealth of experience hard won working on some of the most challenging and innovative customer solutions. I hope to be able to add to the reputation the team has earned over the years.

## The new Blog
If you have visited my blog in the past you will notice not only a new design but hopefully an increase in overall site speed. I have bounced back and forth on many different CMS platforms and never was able to find something that really integrated into my workflow. I am a heavy [Markdown](//daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) user and I will traditionally write posts in Markdown. With many other CMS systems I would have to port that to HTML or other get get formatting working. in the final location.

Beyond just formatting and speed there is always the constant struggle of maintaining a database system on the backend. While I am a data guy and that normally would not bother me, I am big fan of only using the tool that is necessary to get the job done. For what I am doing, a full database system on the back end was overkill. I just wanted to write and publish, not manage a CMS.

As I talked with other bloggers about the dilemma, it was clear that I had not looked at the latest in how blogs were being delivered. There were a host of new plays in the minimalist blogging space including [Ghost](//ghost.org/), [Hugo](//gohugo.io/), and [Jekyll](//jekyllrb.com/).

In evaluating the platforms, I spun them up in a docker container and looked at each platform and then looked at where I was going to host them. Of course, [Azure](//azure.com) would be the logical place, I had a clean slate so I wanted to look at all my options and my development workflow. In the end I chose to go with a Jekyll based site hosted on [GitHub Pages](//pages.github.com/) for free. Hosting on GitHub allowed me focus on writing. Once I checkin my article GitHub Pages leverages Jekyll to convert my Markdown pages into static HTML pages.

## What does it all mean
So with the new gig and the new blog, the inevitable question is: "What does it all mean"? Well, it actually means that you will see more of me blogging from this platform as I work with customers and partners on Azure solutions. This will be the home for all of my blogging for the foreseeable future. I'm looking forward to interacting with you here. Keep an eye on the blog for updates about my experience blogging with Jekyll and the conversion.  If you are looking for some of my older blog posts, I have converted some of the most popular posts. If you are looking for something that is not here, just drop me a line. You can use the [contact](/contact.html) or just reach out to me on [Twitter](//Twitter.com/jgardner04). I look forward to hearing from you.
