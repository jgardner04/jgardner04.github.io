I have been asked you write posts for other publications and even a chapter in a technical book. You will will find excepts and links to those here.

## [Application Development Partner community: Introduction to DevOps](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/msuspartner/2016/08/23/introduction-to-devops/)
Prior to working for Microsoft, I spent 12 years as an IT consultant. On every project I worked on, there was tension between different parts of the organization. Most visibly, the people on the business side had needs that they wanted to apply technology to but saw IT as a blocker to addressing those needs, while the people in IT felt like the business had unrealistic expectations. In addition to this external battle, there is often one within IT as well - developers see operations as a blocker to deploying their applications, while operations sees developers as oblivious to the problems that code can cause. These biases can make it difficult for IT to reach its real potential as a force multiplier in an organization. ***Select the title for more***

## [Application Development: Infrastructure as Code](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/uspartner_learning/2016/08/25/application-development-infrastructure-as-code/)
The concept of infrastructure as code, or programmable infrastructure, plays a significant part in making DevOps possible and is the first step in bringing the development and operations disciplines together within an organization. ***Select the title for more***

## [Application Development: Continuous integration](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/uspartner_learning/2016/08/29/application-development-continuous-integration/)
The software development practice of continuous integration is not simply about tooling. Continuous integration brings together all aspects of a software development project and provides a process that increases the flow of work that's under way. For the purposes of our discussion related to cloud application development, it is the integration of developers and operations personnel to validate that features or changes to the system work, and that they don't conflict with the work of others. This is accomplished through a process with source control, automated build, and test at its core. The practice of continuous integration allows the identification and addressing of bugs quicker, which in turn allows for improved quality. ***Select the title for more***

## [Application Development: Continuous delivery](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/uspartner_learning/2016/09/06/continuous-delivery/)
The idea of continuous delivery can strike terror into the heart of operations personnel. It conjures up the thought of constantly having people in a delivery "war room" to address issues when things go wrong, which does not sound appealing.

Continuous delivery done well, though, is a natural extension of continuous integration (covered in part 3 of this blog series), and eliminates the need for a "war room." And, as with all of the principles we've talked about in this series, continuous delivery is rooted in process, not tools. ***Select the title for more***
