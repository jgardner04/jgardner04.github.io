I have been using a MacBook Pro as my primary work computer for about 6 months now. As a developer, photographer, and video editor I have have always been partial to them in my personal life. I have been spending more and more time in the Terminal app then ever before. I have never really thought much about customizing my Bash Profile before I was trying to do Docker and Git auto-completion. After seeing a few examples, I started working on my own. If you want to jump straight to download the profile you can do that on [GitHub](https://gist.github.com/jgardner04/6f1d85851d0698edb3ac183ad50ff91d).

## Getting Started
Before jumping right into customizing my Bash profile I started doing some research and found that the version of Bash that ships with OS X is not the latest version. The per-installed version is a at least a major release behind. I have been using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) as a package manager for OS X for some time, so when I found out that my Bash shell was behind I went to Homebrew to update it with the command below.

```bash

  brew install bash

```
With bash installed as `/usr/local/bin/bash`, I just needed to change my default shell to use this. I edited `/etc/shells` with `vim` and added the shell at the bottom of the list. Finally, I ran the below command to change the default shell.

```bash

  chsh -s /usr/local/bin/bash

```
After closing and reopening Terminal, I could run `echo $BASH_VERSION` and see 4.4.12(1)-release as the running version of bash.

## Editing the Bash Profile
I don't want this post to turn into a philosophical debate about which editor is the best. I use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) but you can use whatever editor you want. The Bash Profile is located in the home directory as: `~/.bash_profile`.

## Auto Completion
I am lazy, so I love being able to type a few letters and tab through my options when I might not know exactly what I am looking for. For Bash auto-completion, I again have turned to Homebrew to install a package called bash-completion. The following command installs the back-completion package.

```bash

  brew install bash-completion

```
It then needs to be added to the ~/.bash_profile. I have added it along with Git, [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/#installing-bash-completion), and [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) completion. This makes the auto-completion second of my profile look like the code below.

```bash

  # Auto Completion Files

  source '/Users/jgardner/lib/azure-cli/az.completion'
  source '/usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/git-completion.bash'
  if [ -f $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion ]; then
  . $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion
  fi

  # -----------------------

```
## Color the Terminal
In doing research on ways to customize the Terminal window I had seen themes but I also found out that it was possible to use colors to decorate items in the Terminal windows to make quickly identifying information easier. As a fan of the [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) color profile, I found it in a host of theme files in [This GitHub repo](https://github.com/lysyi3m/osx-terminal-themes/tree/master/schemes).

With the Solarized theme installed I wanted to add color context to the terminal. The below code does just that and a bit more. It ads the Git branch into the command line if there is one in the working directory.

```bash

parse_git_branch() {
    git branch 2> /dev/null | sed -e '/^[^*]/d' -e 's/* \(.*\)/ (\1)/'
  }

# Color and display of terminal
  export PS1="\[\033[36m\]\u\[\033[m\]@\[\033[32m\]\h:\[\033[33;1m\]\W\[\033[m\]\[\033[32m\]\$(parse_git_branch)\[\033[00m\] $ "
  export CLICOLOR=1
  export LSCOLORS=GxFxCxDxBxegedabagaced
  alias ls='ls -GFh'

```
The rest of the code adds functionality to the terminal that makes things a little bit easier to use. This includes things like changing the default functionality of the `cd` command to execute my preferred ls command `ls -FGlAhp` or moving into a newly created directory with the new `mcd` command.

```bash

  alias qfind="find . -name "                 # qfind:    Quickly search for file
  ff () { /usr/bin/find . -name "$@" ; }      # ff:       Find file under the current directory

  #   5. PROCESS MANAGEMENT
  #   ---------------------------

  #   findPid: find out the pid of a specified process
  #   -----------------------------------------------------
  #       Note that the command name can be specified via a regex
  #       E.g. findPid '/d$/' finds pids of all processes with names ending in 'd'
  #       Without the 'sudo' it will only find processes of the current user
  #   -----------------------------------------------------
      findPid () { lsof -t -c "$@" ; }

      #   memHogsTop, memHogsPs:  Find memory hogs
  #   -----------------------------------------------------
      alias memHogsTop='top -l 1 -o rsize | head -20'
      alias memHogsPs='ps wwaxm -o pid,stat,vsize,rss,time,command | head -10'

  #   cpuHogs:  Find CPU hogs
  #   -----------------------------------------------------
      alias cpu_hogs='ps wwaxr -o pid,stat,%cpu,time,command | head -10'

  #   topForever:  Continual 'top' listing (every 10 seconds)
  #   -----------------------------------------------------
      alias topForever='top -l 9999999 -s 10 -o cpu'

  #   ttop:  Recommended 'top' invocation to minimize resources
  #   ------------------------------------------------------------
