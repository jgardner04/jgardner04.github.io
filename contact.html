								<p>
									Thanks for the wanting to get in touch with me. There are a bunch of way ways to find. You can use any of the medium below.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong> Email: </strong><a href="mailto:jonathan@beyondthecorneroffice.com">Jonathan@BeyondTheCornerOffice.com</a> I get a lot of email daily. I will do my best to return email as quickly as possible but I am not a fan. This can be reflected in my desire to use <a href="//teams.microsoft.com" target="_blank">Microsoft Teams</a> or <a href="//slack.com" target="_blank"> Slack </a>.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong> Twitter: </strong><a href="//twitter.com/jgardner04" target="_blank">jgardner04</a> This might be best way to reach me. I regularly share content Azure related content and engage in discussion. You can see much of my work history conveyed through my tweets. I do read my direct messages and allow them from people and allow them from people who don't follow me.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong> LinkedIn: </strong><a href="//https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathangardner/" target="_blank">jonathangardner</a> Most of my work history is outlined well here. I accept connections from people I have met in person, talked to, or worked with enough to consider a work contact. I do not respond to messages from people I do not know.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong> Facebook: </strong> I connect with work and public contacts on Twitter and through LinkedIn as mentioned above. I reserve Facebook for friends and family on my personal profile. I do have a Facebook page form my Photography if you are interested in following me there. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jonathanagardnerphotography" target="_blank"> Jonathan Gardner Photography</a>
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong><a href="//whispersystems.org/" target="_blank"> Signal: </a></strong> If you want to get in touch with me through secure channel, I am happy to do so via Signal.
								</p>
								<p>
									<Strong><a href="https://keybase.io/jgardner04" target="">Keybase and Public PGP Key</a></strong> Much like Signal mentioned above, if you would like to communicate with me securely I am on Keybase with many proofs. If you want to encrypt files and send them to me, use the key there.
