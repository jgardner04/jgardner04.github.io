										I am a Senior Program Manager at Microsoft where he works on the Azure CAT GSI team. Before joining Microsoft, I spent 12 years working for Microsoft partners as a consultant working on a wide range of technologies from server virtualization to database administration. After seeing a significant shift to cloud based services, I new it was time to join the best player in the space. Now I am working with our largest customers and partners to help shape the future of the cloud.
									</p>
									<p>
										The goal of this blog is to chronicle the things I have learned along the way and share them with you. Please know that any views expressed on this blog are mine and mine alone. I would never presume to speak on behalf of the views of Microsoft as a whole. We would really love to engage with you. I have included a comments section in each post, included a <a href="/contact.html">contact form</a>, or you can always find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/jgardner04" target="_blank"> Twitter</a>.
									</p>
									<p>
										Outside of work, I am an avid SCUBA diver, foodie, craft beer enthusiast, photographer, and traveler. I live with my wife and two puppies in South Louisiana where I grew up. You can check out my photography on <a href="https://instagram.com/jgardner04" target="_blank">Instagram</a> or on my <a href="https://www.jonathanagardner.com" target="_blank">portfolio page </a> where you can purchase prints or downloads. You will often see my work used throughout the site as well.
